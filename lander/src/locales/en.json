      "q3": "Why would I use this over Lunar or Badlion?",
      "a3": "Generally? Freedom, launcher agnosticism and flexibility. However, everyone is different, so for example traits that put Velquorin in favor in one person may push away others (design language, for example). The choice is yours, you can always try it out to see if you like it!<br><br>tl;dr you might like it, give it a try.",
      "q4": "Can I get banned for using Velquorin?",
      "a4": "No, probably not. Velquorin is not designed to give you any sort of unfair advantage. That said, there were instances of servers banning certain mods (for example, Hypixel banning Freelook), so you have account for that as well.",

      "a6": "Firstly, please consult with the <a href=\"{handbookUrl}\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">handbook <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-alt\"></i></a>, it might contain the fix for your problem. However, if you can't find one, you <a href=\"https://github.com/velquorin/client/issues/new/choose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can open an issue in our repository <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-alt\"></i></a>."
