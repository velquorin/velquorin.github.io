- **Force reload from disk** reloads the configuration from disk. Use when you've made some changes directly to the configuration file and want to apply them.
- **Export** copies the configuration data into your clipboard.
- **Share** uploads your configuration to a pastebin and copies the link to it into clipboard. **Beware** that [the pastebin](https://termbin.com/) you're uploading the configuration to is not owned or operated by me.
- **Import** imports the configuration (in a multitude of formats: pastebin links produced by **Share**, data produced by **Export**, raw configuration data copied from file, etc.) from clipboard.
