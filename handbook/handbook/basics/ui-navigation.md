# Navigating the UI
As stated before, you can open the UI while being in a game world (doesn't matter if it's a realm, a LAN server, a public server, or a singleplayer world), by pressing **Right shift**.

---

### Navigation
- **Right shift** to close (or open) the UI.
- **Escape** to either go back to the previous page, or close the menu if there is no previous page.
- Pages with content lists are **scrollable** via the **Mouse wheel**.

### Sidebar
Navigate between pages using the sidebar, by clicking on the icon:
- Wrench: [Module list](#module-list) & [Module settings](#module-settings)
- Bounds: [Widget repositioning](widgets)
- Globe: [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)

## Module list
This is the page you'll land on by default, when you open the UI for the first time.

<p align="center">
    <img align="center" alt="Menu scheme with notes" src="/ui-tips/module-list.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
  This page lists all modules with descriptions, a knob to toggle them, and a button to configure their settings.
</p>

You can filter the modules shown by:
- Selecting tags: `Enabled`/`Disabled`, `Visual`, `Tweak`, `Vanilla`, `Integration`.
- Searching using the search bar. Indexing considers module settings, names and descriptions making it flexible. 

Widget modules can also be [quickly repositioned](widgets.md) from here.

## Module settings
This is the page you'll land on when you click the settings icon on a module in the module list.

<p align="center">
    <img align="center" alt="Menu scheme with notes" src="/ui-tips/module-settings.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
  This page displays the module info and lists all settings of the selected module, with the ability to modify them.
</p>

You can hover a setting to see its description.

Widget modules can also be [quickly repositioned](widgets.md) from here.

## Miscellaneous
This is the page you'll land on if you click the globe icon on the pages sidebar.

<p align="center">
    <img align="center" alt="Menu scheme with notes" src="/ui-tips/miscellaneous.png">
</p>

You can change the language and [manage the configuration here](managing-config.md).
