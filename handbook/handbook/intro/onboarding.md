### In-game client UI
The client is primarily interacted with via the interface, called the Click GUI, UI and interface across this handbook.
You can access it while being in a game world (doesn't matter if it's a realm, a LAN server, a public server, or a singleplayer world), by pressing **Right shift**.

### Language
If your system language is supported by Velquorin, it will be automatically set in the client by default.

> [!NOTE]
> Language preferences can be adjusted at any time [through the client settings interface](/basics/ui-navigation#miscellaneous).

---
Generally, you're all set! You can start using (or experimenting) with the client right away, [try a configuration from the examples](https://github.com/velquorin/examples),
or continue reading this handbook, for more comprehensive understanding of core features and advanced topics.
