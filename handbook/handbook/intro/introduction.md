### Welcome to Velquorin (**pronounced /ˈvɛl.kwɔː.rɪn/**)!
This is an open-source Minecraft utility mod and a modpack (commonly called a "client"), similar to Lunar or Badlion feature-wise, but more transparent and aimed at the latest version, rather than compatibility with legacy versions.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in heavy development, and thus the handbook might lag behind the latest changes.

## Why this and not *x*?
This project isn't meant to replace every single PvP client. modpack, or utility mod. And it's very likely not going to, at least for most people.
Large projects like Lunar or Badlion have long community backing, big developer teams and cosmetic campaigns - Velquorin doesn't offer most of this.
Some features, however, like cosmetics or legacy version (limited to 1.8.9 and possibly 1.12.2) may be added in the future.

What Velquorin does provide is openness, launcher agnosticism, compatibility, flexibility and ease of use.

If you're curious, the best way to find out is to try.
